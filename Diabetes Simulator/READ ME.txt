The simulation is simple: Eat, do some activities, and give yourself insulin. Keep an eye on your wallet and blood glucose levels (bgl)!

After opening the application and getting to the second form, open the question bubble on the upper right corner.
This help page will tell you how much insulin to administer when you eat or when your sugar is just too high.

Easy tips:
